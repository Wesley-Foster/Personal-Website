		<h4 class="blog_head">My "Contact me" page was my first project that had to do with php and MySQL. The point of the project was for me to be able to show I am able to utilize the basics of using data in a SQL database. The project was for a 3 week study where I studied under my father and learned PHP and SQL.  </h4>
