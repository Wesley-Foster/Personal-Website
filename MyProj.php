		<h4 class="blog_head">My "Contact me" page was my first project that had to do with php and MySQL. The point of the project was for me to be able to show I am able to utilize the basics of using data in a SQL database. The project was for a 3 week study where I studied under my father and learned PHP and SQL. In order to learn about PHP and SQL I used a youtube playlist by TheNetNinja that my sponsor that can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABcXbZLm5G8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gksOX3Kd9KPo-O68ncT05o&index=3&ab_channel=TheNetNinja" target="_blank">here</a>. By using the "Contact me" part of the website to have users input data that will then be inserted into an SQL database that I first made in MyPhpAdmin, then replicated using MySQL on a linuix server, I showed my ability to use the basics of SQL databases. Later I made a page to display the messages sent (this showed my ability to display data from a database), however I did not want anyone to be able to see the messages other than me. I used sessions and another database to make a login page and function within the website, so that only I can access the webpage where the messages are displayed, as well as a few other web pages.
